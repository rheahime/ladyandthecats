    <h2>1. What information do the Applications obtain?</h2>
    
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The Applications generally store game data (such as high scores, card readings, or save files) locally on your device. For certain features (like leaderboards), data may be synced to a secure cloud database (e.g., Google Firebase) to preserve your progress.</p>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>The Applications may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application (e.g., game scores and crash reports).</p>

    <h2>2. Does the Application collect precise real-time location?</h2>
    <p>No. Our Applications do not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

    <h2>3. Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We may work with analytics and advertising partners (like <strong>Google AdMob</strong>) who need to know how you interact with the Application to display advertisements. We do not share your personal identity with these parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Children</h2>
    <p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, please contact us.</p>
